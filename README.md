# to-do-list

This project is an example of one of my first times
using webpack.

It's also pretty much my first time organizing my code
with es6 modules. 

Another first: implementing local storage.

A major focus in organizing this code was experimentation 
with object creation, utilizing inheritance and composition.

Features to be added on return to this project:
-"past due" category if applicable
-sort and filter capabilities
-user profile creation
-dark mode
-style for different priority items
